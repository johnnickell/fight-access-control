# Roadmap

## In progress

No epics are currently in progress.

## Route to 1.0.0

1. Publish completed framework-neutral capabilities as reviewed pre-`1.0.0` package releases, beginning with
   `v0.1.0`, without making full starter implementation a package-release prerequisite.
2. Implement the full Symfony, Laravel, Yii,
   CodeIgniter, and Slim starter skeletons against tagged package versions.
3. Feed shared compatibility findings into reviewed subsequent `0.x` releases while framework-specific fixes
   remain in their owning starter repositories.
4. Run a separate stability review before authorizing a `1.0.0` release.
5. Keep implementation, commit, push, pull request, merge, release, and publication as separate approvals.

## Completed

| Epic | Target | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [EPIC-00006](epics/00006-EPIC.md) | `v0.3.0` | Published the recoverable credential-delivery contract and migration after exact-commit certification and signing. Consumer upgrades remain separately qualified. |
| [EPIC-00007](epics/00007-EPIC.md) | pre-1.0 | Replaced deprecated Fight Common transaction dependencies with the supported `TransactionalUnitOfWork` contract while preserving established behavior. |
| [EPIC-00004](epics/00004-EPIC.md) | `v0.2.0` | Delivered the local consumer-composable OpenAPI schema review candidate; tag, release, and publication remain separate effects. |
| [EPIC-00003](epics/00003-EPIC.md) | 0.x | Delivered the final unified User/Agent `SecurityContext` and retry-safe Agent Permission, User Role, and custom-Role Permission changes. |
| [EPIC-00001](epics/00001-EPIC.md) | 0.x public-source incubation | Delivered the shared identity, credential, session, authorization, and account-lifecycle package slices; a separate stability decision remains required before release. |
| [EPIC-00002](epics/00002-EPIC.md) | 0.x | Delivered Agent HMAC authentication, direct Permission authority, request-scoped Agent resolution, and unified distinct User/Agent current-authority access with exact coverage. |

## Released

| Version | Date | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `v0.3.0` | 2026-09-25 | Published recoverable, provider-neutral credential delivery for invitations, password resets, and email changes, with pre-1.0 breaking migration guidance. |
| `v0.2.0` | 2026-09-13 | Published consumer-composable OpenAPI schema components. |
| `v0.1.0` | 2026-09-10 | First public package milestone: framework-neutral User and Agent identity, authentication, session, Role, Permission, managed-policy, and current-authority behavior with exact coverage. |
